# Basic MongoDB RAG System with Groq
# Requirements: pip install pymongo sentence-transformers groq python-dotenv numpy
"""
Step-by-step flow of this code after running:

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Loads environment variables from a `.env` file using `load_dotenv()`.
   - Configures logging for the application.

2. **Document Data Structure**:
   - Defines a `Document` dataclass to represent documents with fields for id, content, metadata, and optional embedding.

3. **GroqMongoRAG Class Initialization**:
   - When an instance of `GroqMongoRAG` is created:
     - Connects to a MongoDB database using the provided URI, database, and collection names.
     - Initializes a Groq client for LLM-based operations, using an API key from arguments or environment variables.
     - Prepares to load a sentence transformer model for generating embeddings (the code for this is likely in the omitted section).

4. **(Omitted) Core Functionality**:
   - The class is expected to provide methods for:
     - Ingesting documents into MongoDB, possibly with embeddings.
     - Generating embeddings for documents and queries using the sentence transformer model.
     - Retrieving relevant documents from MongoDB based on embedding similarity.
     - Using the Groq LLM to answer questions or generate responses based on retrieved documents.

5. **Usage**:
   - A user would typically:
     - Instantiate the `GroqMongoRAG` class.
     - Add documents to the database.
     - Query the system with a question; the system retrieves relevant documents and uses Groq to generate an answer.

**Summary**:  
This code sets up a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that stores documents in MongoDB, generates embeddings for semantic search, and uses the Groq LLM to answer questions based on the most relevant documents retrieved from the database.
"""
# The Document dataclass represents a single document to be stored and retrieved from MongoDB.
# It contains an id, the main content, optional metadata, and an optional embedding vector.

# The GroqMongoRAG class encapsulates the core Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) logic.
# It manages connections to MongoDB, embedding generation, and interaction with the Groq LLM.

# __init__:
#   Initializes the GroqMongoRAG system.
#   - Connects to the specified MongoDB instance and collection.
#   - Sets up the Groq client for LLM operations.
#   - Prepares the sentence transformer model for embedding generation.

# Additional methods (not shown here) are expected to:
#   - Ingest documents into MongoDB, optionally generating and storing embeddings.
#   - Generate embeddings for queries and documents.
#   - Retrieve relevant documents from MongoDB using embedding similarity.
#   - Use the Groq LLM to answer questions based on retrieved documents.
